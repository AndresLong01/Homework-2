# Homework-2
This Repo Exists for Homework 2

For this Homework I worked a lot on researching bootstrap to adequately 
format my webstie while at the same time not relying on Media Queries.

I started by making a drawing of the website and distilling what was 
being asked of me into a simple diagram.

Once I acknowledged each element that was required to build the website
I dove right into the code.

Here is a list of the Changelog:

1. First I created files for `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html`.
2. Created the basic HTML structure on each file and consequentially titled each page appropriately.
3. started by creating a universal Navbar for which I adjusted colors and used proper descriptions for links.
4. Properly linked the html files with each other giving the page basic functionality.
5. Started working on the main body for the `index.html` and created an about me section within a container-fluid which then was populated by an image of me and some text.
6. Used bootstrap classes to format the body of the `index.html` so as to look appropriate on smaller screens.
7. Started with the `contact.html` using the same container type and offsets as to maintain a consistent look throughout the webpage. Then added Bootstrap classes to create forms for user input.
8. Formatted `contact.html` accordingly.
9. Added a `style.css` file in which I adjusted some values just for the colors to be slightly different.
10. In `portfolio.html` I used a card grid system to equally spread out the images with each of their descriptions.

####BONUS

11. Added a custom "Sticky Footer" to my custom `style.css` file as a bonus.

Throughout this Assignment there were a lot of times where I needed to really dig in and find solutions to the issues presented. It gave me insight into how to search online for answers to the questions I was pondering.
